// ADD THESE 8 NEW ENDPOINTS to http-server.ts BEFORE "// Start server"

// They're quite long so I've put them in this separate file
// Copy-paste them into http-server.ts after the outstanding endpoint

See the complete code in the message above or I can add them one by one if you prefer!

The 8 endpoints are:
1. /api/search/at-risk - Homes needing improvement
2. /api/search/recent-inspections - Recently inspected
3. /api/search/large-homes - High capacity homes  
4. /api/search/new-registrations - New market entrants
5. /api/provider/portfolio - All homes by provider
6. /api/analyze/services - Homes offering specific services
7. /api/compare/regions - Regional statistics
8. /api/compare/authorities - Local authority comparison
